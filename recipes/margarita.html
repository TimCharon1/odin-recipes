    <u><h3>Description</h3></u>
    <p>A margarita is a classic cocktail that typically consists of tequila, 
        lime juice, and triple sec, a type of orange liqueur. 
        It is usually served in a salt-rimmed glass and can be served on the rocks (with ice) 
        or blended with ice to create a frozen margarita. 
        Some variations of the margarita may include additional flavors, 
        such as strawberry or mango, and different types of tequila or citrus fruits. 
        It is a popular drink in bars and restaurants, especially in Mexico and the United States.</p>

        <u><h2>How to:</h2></u>
        <ol>
            <li>Rim the glass: 
                Take a lime wedge and run it around the rim of the glass. 
                Pour some salt onto a plate and dip the rim of the glass into the salt, 
                twisting it to make sure the entire rim is coated in salt.</li>
            <li>Fill shaker with ice: 
                Fill a cocktail shaker with ice, enough to fill the glass you're using.</li>
            <li>Add ingredients: 
                <ul>2 oz of <u>tequila</u></ul>
                <ul>1 oz of <u>lime juice</u></ul>
                <ul>1 oz of <u>triple sec</u> into the shaker</ul> </li>
            <li>Shake well: 
                Secure the lid on the cocktail shaker and shake it vigorously for about 15 seconds 
                to mix the ingredients and chill the cocktail.</li>
            <li>Strain into the glass: 
                Using a cocktail strainer, strain the margarita into the salt-rimmed glass.</li>
            <li>Garnish and serve: 
                Cut a small slit into a lime wedge and slide it onto the rim of the glass.
