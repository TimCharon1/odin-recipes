             <li>2 oz whiskey (usually bourbon or rye)</li>
            <li>1 sugar cube or 1/2 oz simple syrup</li>

        <u><h2>How to:</h2></u>
        <ol>
            <li>Muddle the sugar and bitters:
                Place a sugar cube or 1/2 oz of simple syrup 
                in the bottom of an Old Fashioned glass, and add 
                2 dashes of Angostura bitters. 
                Use a muddler to mash the sugar and bitters together until they form a paste.</li>
            <li>Add the whiskey:
                Pour 2 oz of whiskey into the glass and stir to combine 
                with the sugar and bitters.</li>
            <li>Add ice:
                Fill the glass with ice cubes or one large ice cube.</li>
            <li>Add water or club soda:
                Top the glass with a splash of water or club soda, 
                depending on your preference.</li>
            <li>Garnish: 
                Use a peeler or knife to cut a strip of orange or lemon peel, 
                twist it over the glass to release its oils, and place it in the drink. 
                Optionally, add a maraschino cherry to the glass for a pop of color and sweetness.</li>
            <li>Serve:
