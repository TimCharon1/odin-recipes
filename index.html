    <u><h3>Description</h3></u>
    <p>A margarita is a classic cocktail that typically consists of tequila, 
        lime juice, and triple sec, a type of orange liqueur. 
        It is usually served in a salt-rimmed glass and can be served on the rocks (with ice) 
        or blended with ice to create a frozen margarita. 
        Some variations of the margarita may include additional flavors, 
        such as strawberry or mango, and different types of tequila or citrus fruits. 
        It is a popular drink in bars and restaurants, especially in Mexico and the United States.</p>
